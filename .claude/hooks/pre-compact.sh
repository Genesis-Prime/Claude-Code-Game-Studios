#
# First, the cap bounds the wrong dimension. active.md's lines are long, so 100
# of them was 12.7 KB (~3,200 tokens) -- injected at the one moment context is
# scarcest, and growing with the file.
#
# Second, and worse: content emitted here goes INTO the context that is about to
# be compacted, so it is summarised like everything else rather than preserved.
# We were paying full price for a lossy copy of a file that is already on disk
# -- while post-compact.sh, which fires after, already tells the agent to read
# that file. Pointer + a bounded checkpoint beats a dump on both cost and
# fidelity.
#
# So: emit only the region between the CHECKPOINT markers (bounded by the schema
# in .claude/docs/templates/session-state.md) plus a pointer to the whole file.
